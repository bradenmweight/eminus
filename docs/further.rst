********************

| The source code is openly available at `GitLab <https://gitlab.com/nextdft/eminus>`_.
| The code has been described in a `master thesis <https://www.researchgate.net/publication/356537762_Domain-averaged_Fermi_holes_A_self-interaction_correction_perspective>`_.
| This thesis comes with a detailed implementation of a simplistic DFT code called `SimpleDFT <https://gitlab.com/nextdft/simpledft>`_.
| For more information about implementing DFT using the `DFT++ <https://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/9909130>`_ formulation, fantastic lectures from Tomas Arias can be found `here <https://jdftx.org/PracticalDFT.html>`_.
| The code `JDFTx <https://jdftx.org/index.html>`_ from Ravishankar Sundararaman et al. offers a great reference implementation using C++ using DFT++.
| Another great read is the (currently unfinished) book  from Fadjar Fathurrahman et al. called `Implementing Density Functional Theory Calculations <https://github.com/f-fathurrahman/ImplementingDFT>`_.
| It outlines the implementation of the Julia code, also from Fadjar Fathurrahman et al., called `PWDFT.jl <https://github.com/f-fathurrahman/PWDFT.jl>`_.
