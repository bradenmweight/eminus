Nomenclature
************

The source code uses various nomenclatures for variables for easier reading and understanding.
The most common variables and their meaning will be listed here. Some variables not listed here are explained in docstrings.
Since most variables are :code:`ndarrays` the respective shape will be displayed as well. If the variable is not a ndarray, the respective datatype will be shown.
